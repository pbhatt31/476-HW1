CS 476 HW 1

Documentation: 
To compile the program, use "sbt run" and to test the program, use "sbt test". 

Semantics:
- The fuzzy language and the PBJ language deals with fuzzy sets, variables and operations. The set operations include union, intersection, xor, not, addition and multiplication.
- Like we learned in class and from the book, this program uses scoping so logic gates and variables can be used for different things depending on the scope its declared in.

Limitations:
- Other than the given set operations, there's nothing else the languages can really be used for.
- Fuzzy and PBJ can't tell the difference between the sets and the independent variables.
